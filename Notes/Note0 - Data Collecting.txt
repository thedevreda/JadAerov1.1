    # categories aircraft parts to create a replacement interval #Replacement Interval(200-300 landings) #Replacement Name(Tires, Engines, etc.)
    # datastructre(country,Geographical Location,Replacement Name,Replacement Interval)
# join the two datasets on the airlines and country columns with 
      # airlines = ri => countries
      # aircraft parts = ri => replacement interval common name
